0.0.5 - updated repo to koush's latest 6.0.1.1 build
	moved device and recovery code/files over to github (yay)

0.0.4 - script/script0.bin edits in bootloader to make accessing
	recovery mode from hardware keys possible.
	Hold down VOL+, then press POWER at same time for ~5 seconds,
	let go of POWER, then let go of VOL+ 1-5 seconds later

0.0.3 -	CWMR work has begun. Did a few cosmetic changes
	- Changed background image
	- Changed default background icon to personal thesawolf cwm icon
	- Changed the menu highlight colour from cyan to blue to make it
	  easier to read, white on cyan was hard to read at various angles
	- Added Power off option to menu
	- Made "Go Back" option from submenus active at all times

0.0.2 - Restructure and simplify device files for CM/CWM build 
	(from allwinner-dev-team and christian troy models)
	Made Alpha2 specific, a10's may have common ground but
	ran into too much kernel/module bloat and hw differences
	NOTE: will push this to my own github repo later

0.0.1 - It has begun. ClockworkMod 6.0.1.0 and CyanogenMod9 pulled from
	github repo. Originally used Amery's A10 repo for allwinner 
	kernel 3.0.38 but ran into issues so used allwinner-dev-team's
	kernel 3.0.36 and common framework to build off of. 
	Successfully compiled. Lots of issues. Working with CWM recovery
	first so have a launchpad to work off of instead of having to 
	keep livesuit image reinstalling.

	Issues:
	[CWM] no back button support unless up/down a few times and given
	menu option
	[CWM] no working hardware keys option to enter recovery mode
	(tried various combinations and timings of VOL+/PWR, VOL-/PWR,
	VOL+/VOL-/PWR)
	[CWM] mount usb storage not working
	[CM9] bootanimation - wrong dimensions
	[CM9] no touchscreen hardware keys
	[CM9] interface is phone interface, not loading tablet UI
	[CM9] camera - pictures are saved backwards
	[CM9] camera - zoom in/out not working app
	[CM9] camera - app, restore default settings crashes app
	[CM9] display - the option to show touchscreen presses in debug
	      not working, rest of debug works fine

	Tested:
	[CWM] Install zips, nandroid backup/restores (to/from internal/
	      external sdcard), nandroid deletes (ditto), wipe data/reset,
              mounts, most of advanced menu, adb access
	[CM9] Camera, Video, Microphone, Speakers, Headphones, Wifi,
	      Touchscreen, sdcard (internal/external), adb access, couple
	      basic Apps

	Untested:
	[CWM] advanced restore, partition sd card, fix permissions
	[CM9] actually.. on the skypad itself, too
	      usb devices (ie. otg keyboard, etc.) support is in the kernel
	      and modules, but no way to fully test
	      hdmi output (don't have a HDMI cable to test this out)
